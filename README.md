# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the Docker image for [nginx-pagespeed](https://hub.docker.com/r/hitko/nginx-pagespeed/), based off the official nginx image. See the
[Nginx Hub page](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information
regarding contributing and issues.

Our goloxxly fork adds [ngx_cache_purge module](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge/) to the [Liquid-JS version](https://github.com/Liquid-JS/nginx-pagespeed-docker).
